Getting Started
---------------

To start navigating the compilation, you can use the table of contents on the left. Whether you're a newbie looking for introductory resources or an expert aiming to contribute, Open Compilation has something for everyone. Below are some of the best documentation you can find on ReadTheDocs:

- Soundtext.rtfd.io: `Sound of Text <https://soundtext.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a versatile feature that enables users to convert written text into audible sound, making it a useful tool for various applications such as ringtones, alerts, and notifications. 
- Craigslist.rtfd.io: In this `Readthedocs Craigslist <https://craigslist.readthedocs.io/>`_ documentation, we will discuss what Craigslist is, how to use it, and how to stay safe. We will also provide tips for using Craigslist effectively and avoiding scams.
- Pyscenedetect.rtfd.io: This documentation covers the `PySceneDetect <https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/>`_ command-line interface (the scenedetect command) and Python API (the scenedetect module). The latest release of PySceneDetect can be installed via pip install scenedetect[opencv]. Windows builds and source releases can be found at scenedetect.com/download. 
- Designpatternsphp.rtfd.io: A Data Mapper by `https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io <https://designpatternsphp.readthedocs.io/>`_, is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional transfer of data between a persistent data store (often a relational database) and an in memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern is to keep the in memory representation and the persistent data store independent of each other and the data mapper itself. 
- Puebi.rtfd.io: `PUEBI Online <https://puebi.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a gadget-friendly web version of the General Guidelines for Indonesian Spelling (PUEBI) Permendikbud 50/2015. The content of PUEBI Online is enriched with some additional notes that are not stated or are implicitly stated in the original Permendikbud 50/2015 document.
